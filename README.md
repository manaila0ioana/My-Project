### **1. Introduction:**

The provided Python code is an implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using the Pygame library. Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where the objective is to form a line of three symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.

### **2. Initialization Section:**

The code begins by importing the necessary modules and initializing some fundamental variables.

```python
pythonCopy code
import os
import sys
import pygame

# Data Initialization
FPS = 24
WIDTH = 500
HEIGHT = WIDTH * 1.777777777777778
WINDOW = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
Clock = pygame.time.Clock()
Grid = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

```

- **Pygame Initialization:** The **`pygame`** library is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. In this section, it's used to set up the game window and other features.
- **Data Initialization:**
    - **`FPS`**: Frames per second, determining how many frames the game loads per second.
    - **`WIDTH`** and **`HEIGHT`**: Dimensions of the game window in pixels.
    - **`WINDOW`**: The game window created using Pygame.
    - **`Clock`**: An object to control the frame rate of the game.
    - **`Grid`**: A 2D list representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board. It's initialized with zeros, where 0 indicates an empty cell.

### **3. Setting Application Name and Loading Assets:**

After initializing the game environment, the code sets the application name and loads various assets (images) required for the game.

```python
pythonCopy code
pygame.display.set_caption("TicTacToe by Ioana_Manaila")

# Assets (Images for buttons, X, O, etc.)
# (Some asset-related code is commented out in the provided snippet.)

```

- **Application Name:** The **`pygame.display.set_caption()`** function sets the title of the game window to "TicTacToe by Ioana_Manaila."
- **Assets Loading:** Various images are loaded into the game. These images serve as graphical elements such as buttons, symbols (X and O), and menu screens. The code utilizes the Pygame library to load and transform these images.

### **4. Functions:**

The code defines several functions to handle different aspects of the game.

### 4.1. **`main()`** Function:

The **`main()`** function serves as the central part of the game. It initializes the game state and runs the main game loop.

```python
pythonCopy code
def main():
    State = 0
    Run = True

    while Run:
        Clock.tick(FPS)

        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.quit:
                Run = False

        if State != 1:
            State = home_menu(State)
        if State == 1:
            State = game_menu()

    pygame.quit()
    sys.exit()

```

- **Game State and Main Loop:**
    - **`State`**: Represents the current state of the game. It is initially set to 0.
    - **`Run`**: A boolean variable controlling the game loop.
    - The **`while Run:`** loop continuously updates the game state and handles events.
    - Depending on the state, it calls either the home menu or game menu functions.
    - The loop exits when the user closes the game window.

### 4.2. **`check_win()`** Function:

The **`check_win(num)`** function checks if a player (X or O) has won by examining the rows, columns, and diagonals of the game grid.

```python
pythonCopy code
def check_win(num):
    global Grid

    # Check rows and columns
    for i in range(len(Grid)):
        if all(cell == num for cell in Grid[i]) or all(Grid[j][i] == num for j in range(len(Grid))):
            return True

    # Check main diagonal
    if all(Grid[i][i] == num for i in range(len(Grid))):
        return True

    # Check secondary diagonal
    if all(Grid[i][len(Grid)-i-1] == num for i in range(len(Grid))):
        return True

    return False

```

- **Grid Inspection:**
    - The function uses nested loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the game grid.
    - It checks if all elements in a row or column are equal to the given player number (**`num`**).
    - Additionally, it checks the main and secondary diagonals for a winning condition.
    - If any of these conditions are met, the function returns **`True`**, indicating a win for the player.

### 4.3. **`draw_window()`** Function:

The **`draw_window(img, x, y)`** function updates the display and draws an image at a specific location on the screen.

```python
pythonCopy code
def draw_window(img, x, y):
    pygame.display.update()
    WINDOW.blit(img, (x, y))

```

- **Display Update:**
    - **`pygame.display.update()`** is called to update the display with any changes made.
    - **`WINDOW.blit(img, (x, y))`** draws the specified image at the given coordinates on the game window.

### 4.4. **`home_menu()`** Function:

The **`home_menu(State)`** function handles the home menu. It draws the menu, including buttons for playing and quitting, and responds to user clicks.

```python
pythonCopy code
def home_menu(State):
    draw_window(HOME_MENU_IMAGE, 0, 0)
    draw_window(PLAY_BUTTON_IMAGE, WIDTH/3.18, HEIGHT/2.09)
    draw_window(QUIT_BUTTON_IMAGE, WIDTH/3.18, HEIGHT/1.76)
    if State == 2:
        draw_window(X_WON_MENU_IMAGE, 0, 0)
    if State == 3:
        draw_window(O_WON_MENU_IMAGE, 0, 0)

    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                sys.exit()
            elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
                mouse_pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()

                if PLAY_BUTTON_IMAGE.get_rect(topleft=(WIDTH/3.18, HEIGHT/2.09)).collidepoint(mouse_pos):
                    return 1
                elif QUIT_BUTTON_IMAGE.get_rect(topleft=(WIDTH/3.18, HEIGHT/1.76)).collidepoint(mouse_pos):
                    pygame.quit()
                    sys.exit()

        pygame.display.update()
        Clock.tick(FPS)

```

- **Menu Drawing and Interaction:**
    - The function draws the home menu screen and buttons using **`draw_window()`**.
    - It continuously checks for user events, such as mouse clicks.
    - If the play button is clicked, the function returns 1, indicating a transition to the game menu.
    - If the quit button is clicked, the game exits.

### 4.5. **`game_menu()`** Function:

The **`game_menu()`** function handles the game menu. It draws the game interface, including the Tic-Tac-Toe grid, and responds to player clicks.

```python
pythonCopy code
def game_menu():
    draw_window(GAME_MENU_IMAGE, 0, 0)
    draw_window(MENU_BUTTON_IMAGE, WIDTH/3.18, HEIGHT/1.12)
    aux = 0
    global Grid

    # Drawing the grid
    # (Code for drawing dots is present but commented out in the provided snippet.)

    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                sys.exit()
            elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
                mouse_pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()

                if MENU_BUTTON_IMAGE.get_rect(topleft=(WIDTH/3.18, HEIGHT/1.12)).collidepoint(mouse_pos):
                    Grid = ([0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0])
                    return 0

                # Code for handling player moves is present but commented out in the provided snippet.

        pygame.display.update()
        Clock.tick(FPS)

```

- **Game Interface and Grid:**
    - The function draws the game menu screen, including a button to return to the home menu.
    - It continuously checks for user events, such as mouse clicks.
    - If the menu button is clicked, the function resets the game grid and returns to the home menu.

### **5. Running the Game:**

Finally, the script executes the game by calling the **`main()`** function when the script is run as the main program.

```python
pythonCopy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

- **Game Execution:**
    - The **`main()`** function is the entry point of the game.
    - It initializes the game state and enters the main game loop.
    - The game loop continues until the user closes the game window, handling transitions between the home menu and game menu based on the game state.

### **6. Additional Explanations:**

- **Player Moves and Win Conditions:**
    - The game uses a grid to track player moves (0 for empty, 1 for X, 2 for O).
    - The **`check_win()`** function checks for win conditions by examining the rows, columns, and diagonals of the game grid.
    - If a win condition is met, the game returns to the home menu with a message indicating which player has won.
- **Game Loop and Event Handling:**
    - The game runs in a loop, continuously updating the display and checking for user input events.
    - It responds to mouse clicks during the menu screens, initiating transitions between menus or quitting the game.
    - The main loop continues until the user closes the game window.
- **Asset Management:**
    - The code loads images (assets) to be used in the game, including buttons, symbols for X and O, and various menu screens.
    - These images are then displayed on the game window using the **`draw_window()`** function.
